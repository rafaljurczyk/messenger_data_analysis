I always wanted to learn how to use python to visualize data, and my peer have created a programm that analyze your facebook messages.
First learning pandas from documentation then basing some code (for example how to create plots) on his code I created one that does it.
I learned quite a bit and most of the time I spent cleaning data - just like the internet says.
Nonetheless check out his code! In my opinion it's better and as I said I looked at his code sometimes when I got stucked (like creating plots...)

In my solution after getting files with code you should firstly install libraries provided in requirements.txt

The next step is to download your facebook data. Here is visual representation how to do it. Also there're a lot of tutorials on google!

Extract this file, get only file called messages and put it into same folder as 'main.py'

In params.json change user to your name (don't forget about capital letters and special (polish) characters if required).

If all things went smooth you should be able to just run 'main.py' and get your plots! Have fun!

What can you get from visualed data?
For example I can see how much I used to message everybody when I was in middle school. I was trying to fit in and socialize with everybody.
Most of my top 10 most messaged people are from that time. In college I message only with few closest friends and my girlfriend and from the chat
plot shown below I can say that I don't have to really message people to be liked. Now I'm writing much less and mostly I receive messages.

From the next plot everybody can tell that I have this unhealthy habit of staying on phone before sleep. But on the positive side through most
of my day I try to focus on studying and doing more productive things :)
